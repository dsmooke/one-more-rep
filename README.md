# One More Rep

## Description

This is the seventeenth assignment of the UConn Coding Boot Camp curriculum.

"One-More-Rep" is a fitness workout tracker application that lets the user add an exercise and log the weight, sets, reps, and the duration of each exercise. The user can view their workout history on the `stats` page which displays the total weight lifted as well as the total duration of each workout from their past seven workouts.

## Goals

1. The app will let users add a new exercise type: cardio or resistance.
2. When a user selects `cardio`, the user will be able to enter the exercise name, the distance, and the duration of the exercise.
3. When a user selects `resistance`, the user will be able to enter the exercise name, weight, sets, reps, and duration.
4. View the combined weight of multiple exercises and the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
5. Set up MongoDB Atlas.
6. Deploy app with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.

## User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts.
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of each exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an application that lets users input an exercise's weight, sets, reps, and duration and view the total weight lifted and the total duration of their past seven workouts.
WHEN the user adds a new exercise
THEN the app asks what type of exercise the user is logging: resistance or cardio
WHEN the exercise is a cardio exercise
THEN the user should be able to track the distance traveled
WHEN the exercise is a resistance exercise
THEN the user should be able to track the weight lifted, the number of reps, and the number of sets
WHEN the user clicks on 'view stats'
THEN the user should be able to view the combined weight of multiple exercises and the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts.
